# ML(Machine Learning), we sending inputs(x) and outputs(y) to machine learn this
# More input and outputs = better quility of machine in learning
# All machine do is founfing algorithm of input and outputs
# Good Package fo machine Learning in python is Skilearn(Scikit-learn)
# Machines going to learn and after do by humans datas, So we can say Datas are super important things
# Data's format is usaly csv, Machins are week in Specials, Headers
